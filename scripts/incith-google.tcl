# CHANGE LOG:.................................................. #
#                                                               #
#   1.0: first public release                                   #
#   1.1: improved bolding of search terms, compatible with      #
#          chopped descriptions                                 #
#        supports 'define: <word>' lookups                      #
#        supports calculator. !google (4+3) * 2 - 1             #
#          - converts, too. !google 1 lb in ounces              #
#        image lookups coded, !images <search>                  #
#        'spell: word1 word2' function added                    #
#          - don't rely on this, it's not a dictionary, just    #
#            corrects common typos.                             #
#        flood protection added                                 #
#   1.2: will wrap long lines (yay, a worthy solution!)         #
#        allowed setting of the seperator instead of a ' | ' by #
#          default. If you set this to "\n" then you will get   #
#          each result on a seperate line instead of one line   #
#        will display 'did you mean' if no results              #
#        [PDF] links will be parsed/included now                #
#        fixed a bug when no data was returned from google such #
#          is the case when you search for """"""""""""""""""   #
#   1.3: can return results in multiple languages now           #
#        fixed quotes being displayed around links              #
#        private messages support added (for /msg !google)      #
#        video.google.com seems impossible, Google Video Viewer #
#          is required to view videos, etc                      #
#   1.4: bit of a different output, easier to click links now   #
#        local lookups coded, use !local <what> near <where>    #
#        seems google does currency the same way my exchange    #
#          script does (!g 1 usd in cad)                        #
#        "patent ##" will return the patent link if it exists   #
#        bugfix in private messages                             #
#        sorry to all whom grabbed a borked copy on egghelp :-( #
#   1.5: fix for !local returning html on 'Unverified listing's #
#        "madwoota" has supplied some nice code updates for us! #
#          - "answer" matches, eg: !g population of japan       #
#            - !g <upc code>                                    #
#          - google groups (!gg), google news (!gn)             #
#          - movie: review lookups                              #
#          - area code lookups (!g 780)                         #
#          - print.google lookups (!gp !print)                  #
#        reworked binds to fix horrible bug allowing !g !gi !gp #
#        case insensitive binds (!gi, !GI, !gI, !Gi, etc)       #
#    .1: fix for double triggers/bad binds                      #
#    .2: fix involving "can't read link" error                  #
#-madwoota:                                                     #
#   1.6: fixed google search returning no results               #
#        fixed descriptions getting cut short on 'answers'      #
#        fixed bug where some urls were returned invalid        #
#        fixed google local searches returning no results       #
#        fixed google print searches returning invalid links    #
#        changed 'did you means' to get returned first as well  #
#        added google weather: !g weather <city|zip>            #
#          - note: US weather only (blame google!)              #
#        added travel info, eg: !g sfo airport | !g united 134  #
#        added config option to send output via /notice         #
#        added initial attempt at parsing google video (!gv)    #
#   1.7: added option to force all replies as private (req)     #
#        fixed google groups returning no results               #
#        fixed define: errors on no results                     #
#        fixed google print errors on no results/typos          #
#        fixed movie review errors on no results/typos          #
#        fixed some characters not usable as command_chars on   #
#          one of regular eggdrop or windrop+cygwin             #
#        fixed occasional weird response for travel info        #
#        updated requirements to http package 2.4               #
#        loads of other internal changes                        #
#    .1: fixed search parameters not being parsed correctly     #
#          - resulted in some bogus "no results" replies.       #
#    .2: fixed main google search returning rubbish results     #
#          - google changed their source again                  #
#        changed all methods of parsing the search results to   #
#          *hopefully* cope better with any source changes      #
#        changed output queue to stop the bot from flooding     #
#    .3: fixed some urls being returned with spaces in them     #
#          - makes them unusable in most irc clients            #
#        fixed google groups occasionally returning junk due to #
#          changes in 1.7.2 (will revisit this later)           #
#   1.8: added option to turn on "safe" searches                #
#        added channel user level filtering option (+v/+o only) #
#        added google fight! !gf or !fight <blah> vs <blah>     #

#        added ability to do any custom mode to descs & links   #
#         - i'll just apologise now for this one :)             #
#        removed variable underline_links (superseded by above) #
#        removed use of 'tcl_endOfWord' to stop windrop breaking#
#        fixed excess %20's appearing in some results           #
#        fixed "translate this" only returns ? (i think)        #
#        stopped local from returning ad spam on first result   #
#-speechless                                                    #
#   1.9: updated various regexp's and regsub's in almost all    #
#          procs to fix non functioning html parsing.           #
#        added !localuk option to display United Kingdom.       #
#        added !youtube for searching videos on youtube.        #
#        added !atomfilms for searching videos on atomfilms.    #
#        added !trans for searching videos on trans.            #
#        added !gamespot for searching games, etc.              #
#        added !gamefaqs, it is able to parse multiple systems  #
#          and regions, still a work in progress, all bugs have #
#          been squashed.                                       #
#        added !test proc to help debug and dump html for       #
#          future parsing projects.                             #
#    .1: added !blog for searching blogsearch.google            #
#        added !ebay for searching ebay auctions.               #
#        added !ebayfight for amusement, same as googlefight.   #
#        fixed various miscellaneous minor annoyances in parts. #
#        finally fixed !book (aka print) to work with           #
#          books.google                                         #
#        added !ign for searching movies, games, etc..          #
#    .2: added support for total_search to show total results   #
#          or not. :)                                           #
#        added support for link_only (requested).               #
#        added back complete support for desc/link modes        #
#          they will now affect results properly.               #
#          (note: doesn't affect gamefaqs or locate)            #
#        added !locate for dns location information.            #
#    .3: added !wiki for searching wikipedia for things, very   #
#          much a work-in-progress, don't expect it to be       #
#          perfect.. it just reads very top heading <h*> so     #
#          sometimes it returns next to nothing.. like I said   #
#          it's WIP so don't bitch, thx.                        #    
#        added !review for searching gamefaqs and pulling a     #
#          games review, ranking, score, etc.. works similarly  #
#          to the way !wiki does, has same problem, so this     #
#          is also WIP.. thx                                    #
#    .4: fixed a few regexp parsers to correct broken (no       #
#          results returned) messages in some procs.            #
#        changed google populations to return only 1st desc     #
#          this fixes a small bug where excess html was shown.  #
#          ie. !g population japan || !g population of japan    #
#        fixed google define: links with quick regsub hacks.    #
#        problem with recent ign changing to javascripted html  #
#            so removed their advertising.. too bad for them.   #
#        fixed review and wikipedia to almost perfect.          #
#           note: review does not use forms submittal, instead  #
#           I chose to a single query and field matching on the #
#           first page returned. I may later use forms submital #
#           at some later time.                                 #
#        added two gamerankings triggers (!top/!popular)        #
#        added a mininova torrent search parser.                #
#        fixed parser for !blog by removing quotes. "g" -> g    #
#        beefed up the wikipedia parser so can intelligently    #
#            move to html#subtags to display info.              #
#        removed atomfilms trigger because no one was using.    #
#        added dailymotion trigger for searching tv episodes    #
#            since youtube/google seem to remove those too      #
#            often.                                             #
#        wikipedia now has ability to properly handle internal  #
#            redirects intelligently as well.                   #
#        youtube needed its regexp/regsub parsers tweaked a bit #
#            to handle new html design.                         #
#        google changed format and updated search regexp/sub    #
#            accordingly.                                       #
#        fixed !local lookups, removed !localuk as it was       #
#            redundant since !local covers UK region now.       #
#        corrected !book to actually produce an output again    #
#            i left broken intentionally earlier because of     #
#            lack of interest, but a guy named Zircon sparked   #
#            my interest again. enjoy.                          #
#        gamespot injects paid crap into their html design now  #
#            so found a way to scrape around it.. muahah        #
#        requested by a few people that somehow wikipedia is    #
#            multi-lingual so a fast hack is provided at the    #
#            moment which lacks input checking.. will fix later #
#        requested by a british friend was the ability as well  #
#            for ebay to work from different countries server.  #
#            this also lacks input checking.. will fix later.   #
#        added error catching for erroneous url's in both       #
#            wikipedia and ebay, this way bad user countries    #
#            will be reported with socket errors. thx rosc2112  #
#    .5: major modification of script to allow for dynamic      #
#            language selection of _all_ google sites.          #
#            (search,image,news,local,video,book,blog)          #
#            google group is still broken, will fix later :P    #
#        added !trans for google translate. enjoy.              #
#        added stock quotes (supplied by madwoota)              #
#        fixed translation to convertto foreign charsets.       #
#            fixes display of russian and arabic languages.     #
#        corrected google area code map results.                #
#        added google zip code map results.                     #
#        corrected google movie review lookups, now works!      #
#        search totals was incorrect on some country google     #
#            lookups. it was using elapsed search time as the   #
#            total results, so now a fallback (else) corrects   #
#            it by replace total results with 'google' in       #
#            those instances.                                   #
#        youtube undergoing major html changing to keep bots    #
#            from indexing, so changed some parsers to work.    #
#        added back !ign trigger for scraping ign's search      #
#            page for results.                                  #
#        google answers needed fixing to show correct results.  #
#        added !myspace trigger for searching their video       #
#            content.                                           #
#        corrected zipcode/areacode/airport.                    #
#        corrected all google query possibilities by spending a #
#            few hours fine tuning everything. Most languages   #
#            should work exactly as planned. Some languages     #
#            "may" display incorrectly, but this is by design   #
#            rather than an error, as the script presently uses #
#            unicode for everything except google translations. #
#        major work done to !local fixing it for every possible #
#            query result in almost every language, try it out  #
#            feeding it nonsense and try to find a flaw.        #
#        small bug concerning !google patent ##### .. wasn't    #
#            being caught as results, now all is well again.    #
#        corrected ebay parser with small change to eliminate   #
#            excess html in 'buy-it-now' parsing.               #
#        UPC codes work again.. yay.. how many use this? 1 guy? #
#        Ebay, Wikipedia and Google needed minor fixes to       #
#            correct remaining bits that were left untranslated #
#            now all output will be in language chosen.         #
#        Gamespot changed html design of their page layots for  #
#            reviews, so quick fix to !review proc to handle    #
#            their new design :)                                #
#        Corrected 'results' message displayed with totals to   #
#            also be displayed in language searched in, makes   #
#            the output look much more professional. r0x hard.  #
#            All Google triggers are now 100% dialect perfect.  #
#        Fixed small problem with wikipedia's 'no result'       #
#            message being longer than neccessary.              #
#        Added multi-language ability to youtube because it     #
#            now supports it, new default variable for setting  #
#            language default for it as well. enjoy.            #
#        Changed myspace parser query making it less prone to   #
#            breaking.                                          #
#        Added new trigger !trends to get top search results    #
#            for any date (this is limited by google cache,     #
#            not by the script) and also can be given country   #
#            switches. This is new, at present I cannot go      #
#            back beyond May 2007-05-15 ..                      #
#        Added dual results to !ebay trigger for price/bids     #
#            to account for the fact buy-it-now allows bids as  #
#            well...                                            #
#        Fixed the tiny bug in google answers lookup which      #
#            allowed for cruft to be given as 2nd result.       #
#        Fixed the tiny bug in wikipedia articles that left     #
#            parts of tables in the results.                    #
#        Added forced subtagging ability to wikipedia results   #
#            using their standard sub-tag #this so you can now  #
#            force certain sections to being your results and   #
#            it must only begin with the term doesn't need to   #
#            be entire term to force a sub-tag redirect.        #
#    .6: Added !mediawiki trigger following same abilities as   #
#            the wikipedia trigger.  This is beta at the moment #
#            and the reason this script has a revision change.  #
#        Corrected small issue regarding parsing original search#
#            results which makes this now compatabile with      #
#            every mediawiki page.                              #
#        Fixed problem parsers; Groups, News, Book              #
#        Problems with some procs sorted, Gamefaqs modified to  #
#            work with new php site design.                     #
#        Fixed issues with stubborn always changing google      #
#            based searches.  Now hopefully all triggers work   #
#            again.                                             #
#        Added prepend ability (Requested) so now each of your  #
#            lines, can be prepended with whatever you desire.  #
#        Added 'time in' feature to google search, allows you   #
#            to find out the time in any region, works like     #
#            population and date.                               #
#        Added wiki_line option to expand results.              #
#    .7: Added input/output encoding conversion to better       #
#            realize the multi-language side of this script.    #
#        Corrected mistake in input/output encoding handlers.   #
#        Added a triple lookup for youtube to include all       #
#            possible results and not miss any.                 #

#   .7b: Corrected google to return useful results once again.  #
#            broken was define, no_search, did_u_mean, and      #

#        Ebay now expanded upon to allow 'store' results to     #

#            encoder for those using language other than        #

#            as they appear. All sites that allow this now      #

#   .8b: Corrected deficiencies in !translate, it should now    #

#   .9c: Addded a crude work around to allow youtube to remain  #

#            and some other things I forgot about.              #
#        Corrected short_answers, created new option skip_self  #
#            to deal with google self-injecting results.        #
#        Corrected google did_you_mean and no_results messages  #
#            once again. Stop changing so often google, jeez..  #
#   .9v: Corrected wikipedia/wikimedia #achor lookup method, it # 
#            it's now more accurate and much faster.            #

#        Corrected translate to use new templates. yes, google  #
#            was busy updating all their templates :(           #
#        Added new feature to custom trigger phrasing:          #
#            * ability to query by index as well as entire      #
#              sentence..                                       #

#            things causing lots of functionality to break.     #
#            suffice to say it's fixed. Most of it. Good show   #
#            google, but it's now your move again. This game of #

#  .... : stuff                                                 #
#  2.1x : more stuff, this version number shall be re-used      #

#         revision below, or the date at top of script to know  #
#         any of that irrelevant stuff.                         #

#   Once everything above is done we can start on these:        #
#     Clean-up code where obvious hacks were left in, code them #
#       correctly, remove debugging code from procs which is    #
#       presently commented out.                                #
#     Clean-up overly messy code that can be solved by coding   #
#       cleaner modules and not reusing so much code.           #

    # This part was requested to be added so now here it is, it has
    # various prepends you may wish to have preceed each function.
    # To use this, just change what you see below from nothing to
    # something...ie, if you want [ GOOGLE ] to prepend google
    # search results change the search_prepend to "\[GOOGLE\]". You
    # can do the same with all of the following prepends, they will
    # start the output for each line. If you don't wish to use this,
    # leave them as "". Keep in mind tcl special characters MUST be
    # escaped or will cause tcl errors, and/or crash your bot. This
    # is your own problem, just be aware. Read about them if possible.
    #
    # Note 1: Prepends will increase your line length, and won't be
    # accommodated for in the max line length setting, so you may
    # find you need to lower your max line length setting if your
    # prepends are lengthy or contain lots of escape sequences. If
    # you don't you  may find the bots replys may get cut short or
    # cut completely by the ircd your using.
    #
    # Note 2: To use color, bold, etc.. simply use the proper escape
    # sequence to generate it here, make sure to properly CLOSE your
    # sequence (\003 for color, \002 for bold, etc) or you will see
    # the effect of the prepend bleed thru into your output as well.
